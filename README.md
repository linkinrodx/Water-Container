# Water-Container

Given **n** non-negative integers **a1 , a2 , ..., an**, where each represents a point at coordinate **(i, ai)**. **n** vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line **i** is at **(i, ai)** and **(i, 0)**.
Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

**Notice** that you may not slant the container.

*Example 1:*

```
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
```

Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7].
In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

*Example 2:*
```
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
```

*Example 3:*
```
Input: height = [4,3,2,1,4]
Output: 16
```

*Example 4:*
```
Input: height = [1,2,1]
Output: 2
```

*Constraints:*
```
n == height.length
2 <= n <= 3 * 10^4
```

## Start 🚀

For this challenge I created a console project with netcore 3.1

Just run the console app and use the program
